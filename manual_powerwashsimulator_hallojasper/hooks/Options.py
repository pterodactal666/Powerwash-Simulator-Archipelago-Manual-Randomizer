# NOTE: At the time that options are created, Manual has no concept of the multiworld or its own world.
#       Options are defined before the world is even created.
#
# Example of creating your own option:
#
#   class MakeThePlayerOP(Toggle):
#       """Should the player be overpowered? Probably not, but you can choose for this to do... something!"""
#       display_name = "Make me OP"
#
#   options["make_op"] = MakeThePlayerOP
#
#
# Then, to see if the option is set, you can call is_option_enabled or get_option_value.

# To add an option, use the before_options_defined hook below and something like this:
#   options["total_characters_to_win_with"] = TotalCharactersToWinWith
