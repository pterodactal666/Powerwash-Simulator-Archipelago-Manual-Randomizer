# Q. What are the progression items and their order?
# A. Progressive items:
#        Progressive Nozzles for each power washer: white, green, yellow, red, turbo, triple tip in that order
#        Progressive Extensions for each power washer: short, long, extra long
#        Stepstool (can still be moved out of the way, just not used to gain height)
#        Progressive ladder: base length, halfway extended, fully extended
#        Scaffolding Floors (Allows you to go up that many floors on a scaffolding)
#        Completion Stars (70 stars to goal in Parts Mode, 35 to goal in Percentage Mode)
# 
# Q. How do I know where to clean?
# A. For Parts Mode:
#        Level Part Unlocks: Allows cleaning of various parts in levels.
#        All Locations show which "Level Part Unlock" is required for that location by the name between *
#        Example: the location "Back Garden Stepping Stones *Patio*" requires the "Back Garden Patio" item.
#        A few locations also have a number, this is for the few locations for which that part name appears that many times in the in game parts list, all have to be cleaned for the check.
#    For Percentage Mode:
#        Level Unlocks: Allows cleaning that level.
